# Blockcityfi NFT Marketplace

## Overview

Blockcityfi NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain, utilizing Smart Contracts written in Clarity. This marketplace enables users to mint, buy, sell, and interact with NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) while incorporating an intrinsic value protocol.

## Features

- **Minting:**
  - Mint a collection with finite or infinite NFTs.
  - Users select a license from [a16zcrypto NFT licenses](https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/introducing-nft-licenses/) to be stored with the NFT.

- **Buying:**
  - Users can buy NFTs from the marketplace.
  - At the time of purchase, users can choose the percentage to be stacked.

- **Charge:**
  - Bring existing NFTs to the platform and assign an intrinsic value.

- **Recharge:**
  - Add more STX (Stacks tokens) to existing NFTs.

- **Intrinsic Value:**
  - Each NFT has an on-chain intrinsic value.
  - Passive income from Proof of Transfer (POX) rewards collectors and creators.

- **Price Appreciation:**
  - When the Bitcoin price increases, the market value of NFTs also appreciates.

- **Selling:**
  - When an NFT is sold, a percentage of the transaction is added to the intrinsic value.
